### About Me

I'm a backend architect specializing in robust and scalable system design with extensive experience across multiple domains:
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Design and implementation of high-throughput financial systems with emphasis on security, compliance, and reliability
- **E-commerce Infrastructure**: Building resilient microservice architectures supporting millions of transactions and seamless user experiences
- **AI Integration Specialist**: Currently focused on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for advanced speech processing and computer vision applications

My work bridges traditional enterprise systems with cutting-edge AI technologies, creating solutions that are both production-ready and future-proof.

### Current Focus

🔭 I'm currently working on:
- Implementing real-time speech processing pipelines using state-of-the-art LLMs
- Developing computer vision solutions with multimodal AI models
- Optimizing inference performance for production-grade AI applications

💡 My expertise combines deep technical knowledge of distributed systems with practical AI implementation experience, allowing me to design architectures that effectively handle both computational demands and business requirements.

### 🤝🏻&nbsp;Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing innovative approaches to system design or collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with AI and enterprise architecture.
